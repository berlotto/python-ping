This library is a fork of George Notaras' python-ping library, which is
an implementation of the standard ICMP ping in pure Python.

As it uses raw ICMP sockets, you need to be root to use the functions
exported by the ping module.

This fork by Pierre Bourdon adds a setup.py file in order to permit an
easier distribution of the package. The license of the library remains
unchanged (GPLv2), see COPYING.
